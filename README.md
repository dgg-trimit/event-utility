# event-utility
JavaScript event utility - props to Jeremy McPeak of tuts+

A very simple cross-browser JavaScript event utility; does exactly what it says on the tin. 

An object with the following methods:

- addEvent: used to add an event
- removeEvent: used to remove an event
- getTarget: used to get the target of an event
- preventDefault: prevent the default action of an event
